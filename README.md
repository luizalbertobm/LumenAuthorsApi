# Lumen Authors API
I did this project following a Udemy course called 
[Lumen Microservices: Create Services and APIs with Lumen](https://www.udemy.com/course/microservices-with-lumen-a-service-oriented-architecture/).

I builded a complete set of PHP microservices and APIs and its security layers using Lumen and OAuth2


Laravel Lumen is a stunningly fast PHP micro-framework for building web applications with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable, creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Lumen attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as routing, database abstraction, queueing, and caching.
